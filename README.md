# International-Stock-Markets

MATLAB codes for a comprehensive analysis of international stock markets, in particular, how broad stock market returns of developed and developing countries are affected by different factors. We investigate lead/lag relationships of monthly stock return and find limited to no evidence of predictability of international stock returns across countries.


We perform various tests to check relationships between countriesâ€™ characteristics such as nominal interest rates and dividend yields, time-series such as returns on oil and gold and future broad stock market returns. We investigate on-time co-movement of all coun- tries with China and US stock markets by calculating rolling window realized correlations between them. Finally, we perform LASSO regressions to choose a set of best predictors (with a penalty for a number of regressors) for each country in-sample and validate its out-of-sample performance relative to the historical average.
